In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

You can change your teammate between Cups as long as they're in the same Division as you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">In Elite Cups, your progress combines over both days and you cannot switch teammates until the next week of competition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Are the Contender/Challenger/Elite classifications the same as Arena Divisions?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">No. Arena still has the same Open/Contender/Champion Divisions it did before. These new classifications are only for the new, weekly Divisional Cup series and have no ties to Arena outside of the necessary Contender League requirement to get started.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Good luck in Chapter 4 Season 1, competitors!</p>\n",

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://www.discord.gg/fncompetitivesupport&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives.

In this $75,000 prize pool tournament, teams of Trios were tasked to conquer the competition in both Fortnite Zero Build and Battle Royale, resulting in teams constantly evolving their strategies and thrilling gameplay.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZ1aGpltuk\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>We spoke with the winning team of the third WOTE tournament ‚Äì <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxddylol\">Mxddy</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yqzmin1x\">Yqzmin1x</a> ‚Äì about how they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eFuse/status/1581826791420764160\">conquered the eRena</a>, their history with Fortnite, how they became Fortnite teammates, and more:</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCongratulations on winning the WOTE Featuring Fortnite tournament! What were some of the strategies you used to win?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxddylol\">Mxddy</a>: A strategy we used for all six games was to loot up quickly, and get on top of the Rave Cave bear head and get a ton of Surge tags so we would be set for the whole game. Carrying a sniper gave us pretty easy surge tags. I also took a lot of time to VOD review pro in-game leaders in Zero Build, since it was my job to rotate my team in the best spots on the map.<br />\n<br />\nI don‚Äôt know much about regular build comp, so I just did what I thought was best for the team and looked for elims and refreshes. I think our lowest placement in all six games was third place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>: My trio and I decided on landing at Rave Cave for the tournament, as it was the spot we thought would work best with Zero Build as well as build games.<br />\n<br />\nWe made our main focus on surge and positioning and saved our fighting for endgame to prevent any third parties from griefing our game. The games were stacked, so we knew as long as we stayed above surge and had a good spot in-zone that free elims would come to us from those who didn‚Äôt stay above surge.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nTell us about your history with Fortnite: When did you start playing? When did you start competing?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>: I started playing the game back in Chapter 1 Season 8 when my sister convinced me to start playing with her as well as my friends from school. I would sometimes play tournaments with friends just for fun but actually started to take comp more seriously in the second Season of Chapter 3.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxddylol\">Mxddy</a>: I started playing in Chapter 1 Season 3, and I was a complete bot. I never really started competing ‚Äî I only play pubs and occasionally Zero Build Cups with friends. I hardly ever played Arena or anything of the sort, but I played a lot of Zero Build Arena. I‚Äôve learned everything I know just from watching competitive players compete and applied it to our games. I ended up getting fourth in overall player rank!</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"20Comp Evergreens Blue Social\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/20comp-evergreens-blue-social-1920x1080-47ae83b3d41a.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nWhat inspired you to sign up for the WOTE Featuring Fortnite tournament with your team?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yqzmin1x\">Yqzmin1x</a>: I always watched other women compete in WOTE tournaments. It was inspiring to see all the thrill in winning and even competing, and I wanted to have that same opportunity!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>: I have played and performed pretty well in multiple eFuse tournaments, so there was no question that I was going to be playing in this one as well. I reached out to Yqzmin1x, as I knew she also took comp seriously and that we had potential to win together. Neither of us play Zero Build, so we knew our third teammate had to be someone with more experience in something we both struggle with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many people told us to reach out to Mxddy, as she is super experienced with Zero Build ‚Äî and they weren‚Äôt wrong as we ended up making a crazy trio together!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nWhat advice do you have for anyone who may be on the fence about competing in their first tournament?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>: Good placements come with experience and practice such as scrimming, playing ladders, and VOD reviewing. Most people don‚Äôt perform as they would want to when first jumping into competitive, but as you gain more experience, you will see improvement in your placements and gameplay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxddylol\">Mxddy</a>: Grab a team you feel confident in! I‚Äôve made mistakes where I just play with someone to just have someone. Reach out to people and find someone that you really mesh with and play well with. Make sure they have good vibes as well, even if you aren‚Äôt doing as good as you‚Äôd like.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yqzmin1x\">Yqzmin1x</a>: You miss all the chances you don‚Äôt take, and overall it‚Äôs really fun and gives such an awesome competitive feeling. Practice makes perfect!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nWith this victory under your belt, what‚Äôs next for you?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mxddylol\">Mxddy</a>: Back to public games for me! I will 100% be competing in future Zero Build tournaments every once in a while, but I have the most fun streaming public Zero Build matches with my friends. If another tourney pops up, Kelszy, Yqzmin1x, and myself are coming for that win!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelszy_\">Kelszy</a>: Definitely going to continue to play Fortnite competitively and possibly start streaming again in the near future.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yqzmin1x\">Yqzmin1x</a>: I plan on growing my platforms, inspiring people, and letting them know anything is possible, and I definitely want to give back to the people who always supported me. Lastly, GOING BACK TO BACK IS A PLAN!</p>\n",

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

If one member of a team fails the verification of eligibility process, both members of that team will be disqualified as potential Winning Players, and that team shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event; provided, for clarity, that a team member who resides within a Prize Restricted Region shall not automatically force a disqualification of the other team member as a potential Winning Player pursuant to this Section 4.1.3.<br />\n<br />\n4.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each member of a team shall be deemed to have jointly and severally made and entered into all of the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and shall be jointly and severally obligated and bound thereby. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.<br />\n<br />\n4.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Round 2, Round 3, and Round 4 qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://www.discord.gg/fncompetitivesupport&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic). In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations and move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; and/or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable sanction by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable sanction specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Violation Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters.

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives.

If one member of a team fails the verification of eligibility process, all members of that team will be disqualified as potential Winning Players, and that team shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event; provided, for clarity, that a team member who resides within a Prize Restricted Region shall not automatically force a disqualification of the other team members as potential Winning Players pursuant to this Section 4.3.1.<br />\n<br />\n4.3.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each member of a team shall be deemed to have jointly and severally made and entered into all of the representations, warranties, and agreements contained herein and shall be jointly and severally obligated and bound thereby. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.3.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Round 2 qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.

Any actions of a player which lead to a disconnection shall be deemed intentional, regardless of the actual intent of the player. Intentional disconnection is not considered a valid technical issue for the purposes of a remake.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n5.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Server Crash&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAll players losing connection to the Game due to an issue with the Game server.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Unintentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to problems or issues with the game client, platform, network, or PC.<br />\n<br />\n5.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Technical Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the nature and scale of online competition, except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, matches will not be restarted or made null due to Bugs, Intentional Disconnections, Server Crashes, or Unintentional Disconnections. Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://www.discord.gg/fncompetitivesupport&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic). In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; and/or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable sanction by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable sanction specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Violation Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity; Interview Consent<br />\n<br />\n11.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Epic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n11.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Epic may, from time to time, reach out to players for an opportunity to voluntarily participate in an interview in connection with the Event (each, an ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù).
